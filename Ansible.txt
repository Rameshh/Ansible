Ansible is an open source IT Cofiguration Management, Deployment and Orchestration tool.

No other client software is installed on the node machines. 
It uses SSH to connect to the nodes. 
Ansible only needs to be installed on the control machine which can even be your laptop.

* Ansible Terms:
1. Controller Machine -> The machine where Ansible is installed, responsible for running the provisioning on the servers you are managing.
2. Inventory -> An initialization file that contains information about the server you are managing.
3. Playbook -> The entry point for Ansible provisioning, where the automation is defined through tasks using YAML format.
4. Task -> A block that defines a single procedure to be executed, ex: Install a package.
5. Module -> A module typically abstracts a system task, like dealing with packages or creating and changing files.
6. Role -> A pre-defined way for organizing plybooks and other files in order to facilitate sharing and resuing portions of a provisioning.
7. Play -> A provisioning executed from start to finish is called a play. In simple workds, execution of a playbook is called a play.
8. Facts -> Global variables containing information about the system, like network interfaces or operating system.
9. Handles -> Used to trigger service status changes, like restarting or stopping a service.

* Advantages Of Using Ansible
1. Simple -> Ansible uses a simple syntax written in YAML called playbooks.
2. Agentless -> Finally, Ansible is completely agentless.
3. Poweful & Flexible -> Ansible has powerful features that can enable you to model even the most complex IT workflows.
4. Efficient -> No extra software on your servers means more resources for your application.

* What Ansible Can Do?
1. Provisioning
2. Configuration Management
3. Application Deployment
4. Security and Compliance
5. Orchestration

* What is Ansible & its Architecture?
* The Ansible Automation engine consists of:
1. Inventories -> Ansible inventories are lists of hosts(nodes) along with their IP addresses, servers, databases etc.
2. APIs -> APIs in Ansible are used as transport for Cloud services, public or private.
3. Modules -> Modules are executed directly on remote hosts through playbooks.
4. Plugins -> Plugins allows to execute Ansible tasks as a job build step.

* Few more components in Ansible Architecture:
1. Networking -> Ansible can also be used to automate different networks.
2. Hosts -> The hosts in the Ansible architecture are just node systems which are getting automated by Ansible.
3. Playbooks -> Playbooks are simple files written in YAML format which describes the tasks to be executed by Ansible.
4. CMDB -> It is a repository that acts as a data warehouse for IT installations.
5. Cloud -> It is a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server.

* Ansible in DevOps
Plan -> Code -> Continuous Integration -> Build -> Test -> Continuous Management -> Deploy -> Monitoring -> Plan

* Install Ansible on CentOS
1. Set EPEL(Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) Repository
   sudo rpm -ivh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
2. Install Ansible
   yum install ansible -y
3. ansible -version
 
* Post Installation
1. Generate SSH key on the Ansible Control Machine.
   ssh-keygen
2. ifconfig
3. Copy public key of Ansible server to its nodes.
   ssh-copy-id -i root@192.168.15.200(ip address of your node machine)
4. Open the file and update the ip address of node machine
   vim /etc/ansible/hosts
5. Ping operation to test the connectivity using Ansible.
   ansible -m ping 'test-servers'
6. Check uptime of your node machines.
   ansible -m command -a "uptime" 'test-servers'
7. Check kernel version of your nodes.
   ansible -m command -a "uname -r" 'test-servers'

* Deploy Nginx Using Ansible
1. ansible test-servers -m yum -a "name=nginx state=installed"
2. ps waux | grep nginx
